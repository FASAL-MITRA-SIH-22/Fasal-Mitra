There are many strategies for varying the learning rate during training, and the one we‚Äôll use is called the *‚ÄúOne Cycle Learning Rate Policy‚Äù*, which involves starting with a low learning rate, gradually increasing it batch-by-batch to a high learning rate for about 30% of epochs, then gradually decreasing it to a very low value for the remaining epochs.\n","\n","- **Weight Decay**: We also use weight decay, which is a regularization technique which prevents the weights from becoming too large by adding an additional term to the loss function. \n","\n","- **Gradient Clipping**: Apart from the layer weights and outputs, it also helpful to limit the values of gradients to a small range to prevent undesirable changes in parameters due to large gradient values. This simple yet effective technique is called gradient clipping.\n","\n","We'll also record the learning rate used for each batch."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-22T18:25:34.465154Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-22T18:25:34.464894Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-22T18:25:34.478169Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-22T18:25:34.477376Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-22T18:25:34.465118Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# # for training\n","# @torch.no_grad()\n","# def evaluate(model, val_loader):\n","#     model.eval()\n","#     outputs = [model.validation_step(batch) for batch in val_loader]\n","#     return model.validation_epoch_end(outputs)\n","\n","\n","# def get_lr(optimizer):\n","#     for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:\n","#         return param_group['lr']\n","    \n","\n","# def fit_OneCycle(epochs, max_lr, model, train_loader, val_loader, weight_decay=0,\n","#                 grad_clip=None, opt_func=torch.optim.SGD):\n","#     torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n","#     history = []\n","    \n","#     optimizer = opt_func(model.parameters(), max_lr, weight_decay=weight_decay)\n","#     # scheduler for one cycle learniing rate\n","#     sched = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR(optimizer, max_lr, epochs=epochs, steps_per_epoch=len(train_loader))\n","    \n","    \n","#     for epoch in range(epochs):\n","#         # Training\n","#         model.train()\n","#         train_losses = []\n","#         lrs = []\n","#         for batch in train_loader:\n","#             loss = model.training_step(batch)\n","#             train_losses.append(loss)\n","#             loss.backward()\n","            \n","#             # gradient clipping\n","#             if grad_clip: \n","#                 nn.utils.clip_grad_value_(model.parameters(), grad_clip)\n","                \n","#             optimizer.step()\n","#             optimizer.zero_grad()\n","            \n","#             # recording and updating learning rates\n","#             lrs.append(get_lr(optimizer))\n","#             sched.step()\n","            \n","    \n","#         # validation\n","#         result = evaluate(model, val_loader)\n","#         result['train_loss'] = torch.stack(train_losses).mean().item()\n","#         result['lrs'] = lrs\n","#         model.epoch_end(epoch, result)\n","#         history.append(result)\n","        \n","#     return history\n","    "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Let's check our validation loss and accuracy"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-22T18:25:34.481345Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-22T18:25:34.481130Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-22T18:27:00.454726Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-22T18:27:00.453932Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-22T18:25:34.481312Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# %%time\n","# history = [evaluate(model, valid_dl)]\n","# history"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Since there are randomly initialized weights, that is why accuracy come to near 0.019 (that is 1.9% chance of getting the right answer or you can say model randomly chooses a class).\n","Now, declare some hyper parameters for the training of the model.
