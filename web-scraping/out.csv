Apple___Apple_scab,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/apple-scab-apple-3.jpg, The first visible symptoms of apple scab appear in the spring in the form of minute  circular  olive-green spots on leaves  often along a main vein. As they enlarge  they become brownish-black and eventually coalesce to form large patches of necrotic tissue. Affected leaves are often deformed and fall off prematurely  leading to defoliation in case of heavy infections. On shoots  the infections causes blistering and cracking that can then provide entry for opportunistic pathogens. On the fruits  brown to dark brown circular areas appear on the surface. As they develop further  they often coalesce and become raised  hard and corky. This restricts the expansion of the fruit and leads to distortion and cracking of the skin that expose the flesh. Light attacks do not affect the fruit quality significantly. However  the scabs can expose the fruits to opportunistic pathogens and rots  reducing the storage capacity and the quality. , Apple scab is a disease caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. It survives the winter mainly on infected leaves on the ground but also on bud scales or lesions on wood. At the onset of spring  the fungus resumes growth and starts to produce spores  which are later discharged and dispersed over long distances by the wind. These spores land on developing leaves and fruits and start a new infection. Outer parts of unopened fruit buds are highly susceptible to scab. However  as the fruit matures it becomes much less susceptible. Humid environment  wetting period of leaves or fruits are essential for the infection. Alternative hosts include shrubs of the genus Cotoneaster  Pyracantha and Sorbus. All apple varieties are susceptible to scab  with Gala being more vulnerable. , If disease levels were high the previous season  liquid copper fungicides can be sprayed to impede the fungal growth on the tree during the winter season. Sulfur sprays are only partially effective against apple scab. However  solutions containing sulfur and pyrethrins are available for organic control of the disease during the growing season. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Protectant fungicides such as dodine  captan or dinathion can be sprayed around bud break to avoid the disease. Once scab has been detected  fungicides based on difenoconazole  myclobutanil or sulphur can be used to control the development of the fungus. Ensure scab fungicides from different chemical groups are used to avoid the development of resistance. 
Apple___Black_rot,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/black-rot-1.jpg, In most cases  the damage on the cabbage leaves appear only in late summer. The main symptoms show as yellow  wedge-shaped patches on the edge of leaves  later moving inwards onto the leaf and downwards into the stem. This symptom distinguishes black rot from Fusarium wilt  where symptoms move upwards from the ground level towards the stem. As the disease progresses  the yellowing part of the leaf enlarges and turns brown as the tissues die. Leaf veins turn black at the final stage of the disease  thereby the common name of the disease. Eventually  the leaf collapses. The pathogen may enter the stem and spread through the vascular system  something that is visible as a ring of black discoloration when cut near the soil surface. , The symptoms are caused by the soil-borne bacterium Xanthomonas campestris  which survives in infected crop debris or seeds for up to 2 years  or on weeds of the Brassica family for longer periods. It affects a large number of vegetables in the cabbage family (including broccoli  cauliflower  turnip  radish  kohlrabi). The bacterium spreads to healthy plants via water splashes and enters the tissues through different paths  among other injuries. Once a plant becomes infected  the disease spreads quickly to other cabbages. If soils or seeds are contaminated  the first symptoms can be observed already in the propagation bed. Environmental conditions that favor the bacteria and the infection process are high humidity and temperature in the range of 25-30 °C. Densely planted crops provide conditions that are ideal for bacterial spread to nearby plants. In those conditions  crop yields can be reduced by as much as 75-90%. , A hot water bath for 30 minutes at 50 °C is the recommended treatment to sterilize the seeding material. This is not 100 percent effective against black rot but reduces the incidence of the disease considerably. The drawback is that it might lower the seeds germination rate. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Seed treatments with hot water are very effective to block the contamination of fields. Foliar treatments with copper based fungicides every seven to ten days are also used to slow the spread of the disease. Unfortunately  these treatments can cause black spots to develop of the outer leaves of the cabbage. 
Apple___Cedar_apple_rust,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/european-pear-rust-pear-1.jpg," Small  brown  circular spots develop first onto the upper surface of leaves. As they enlarge  they turn bright orange-red with a dark brown center. In late summer  grain-shaped  brownish and gall-like outgrowths can be observed on the underside of leaves. Occasionally  the fungus can also cause lesions and sunken cankers in the bark of branches and young trunks. Even though the fruits are not directly affected  a severe infection can cause defoliation and crop losses.
 ", The symptoms are caused by the fungus Gymnosporangium sabinae  which attacks both pear trees and junipers. Pears are only an intermediate host for the pathogen and both trees are actually needed to complete its life cycle. It is not able to survive on dead plant material  so it must alternate between hosts. The fungus hibernates in juniper  which is its primary host. In spring  the spores spread from juniper and infect nearby pear trees. The spots that emerge on the underside of the pear leaves are in fact spore-producing structures. These spores cannot reinfect pear leaves  so by the end of the summer  they are dispersed over long distances (up to 500 meters) to infect new junipers. There  it causes perennial horn-like swellings on the branches. These outgrowths are particularly conspicuous in spring  following periods of high humidity.  , As of today  no biological treatment is known for this disease.  , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Low levels of infection are usually not a problem and can simply be ignored.  Fungicides based on difenoconazole can be used to control the disease. For home gardeners  the fungicides tebuconazole  tebuconazole with trifloxystrobin  and triticonazole are approved for the control of rust diseases.  
Cherry_(including_sour)___Powdery_mildew,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/powdery-mildew-melon-1580314319.jpg, The infection usually starts off as circular  powdery white spots which can affect leaves  stems and sometimes fruits. It usually covers the upper parts of the leaves but may grow on the undersides as well. The fungus hinders photosynthesis and causes the Leaves turn yellow and dry out and some leaves might twist  break or become disfigured. In the later stages  the buds and growing tips become disfigured. , Fungal spores overwinter inside leaf buds and other plant debris. Wind  water  and insects transmit the spores to nearby plants. Even though it is a fungus  powdery mildew can develop rather normally in dry conditions. It survives at temperatures between 10-12°C  but optimal conditions are found at 30°C. In contrast to downy mildew  small amounts of rainfall and regular morning dew accelerate the spreading of powdery mildew. , Foliar sprays based on sulfur  neem oil  kaolin or ascorbic acid can prevent severe infection. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. In view of the number of crops that are susceptible to powdery mildew  it is difficult to recommend any particular chemical treatment. Fungicides based on wettable sulphur (3 g/l)  hexaconazole  myclobutanil (all 2 ml/l) seem to control the growth of the fungus in some crops. 
Corn_(maize)___Common_rust_,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/common-rust-of-maize-maize-1.jpg, Minute flecks appear on both sides of the leaves and slowly develop into small  tan  slightly raised spots. These mainly elongated spots later turn into powdery  golden-brown pustules loosely scattered in patches on upper and lower sides. The color can change to black as the plant matures. Contrarily to other rust diseases  symptoms are not usually present on other plant parts  such as stalks  sheath leaves or husks. However  stalks tend to grow weak and soft and are prone to lodging. Younger leaf tissue is more susceptible to fungal infection than mature leaves. Plants infected during the early stages can show chlorosis of leaves and death  leading to high yield losses if upper leaves are affected. , The disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. The fungus overwinters in an alternate host (a species of Oxalis) and releases spores during the spring. The spores can be transported over great distances by winds and rain. They start the infection process when landing on the leaves. Secondary infection from plant to plant can also occur due to wind and rain. The development of the disease is favored by high relative humidities (nearly 100%)  dew  rain and cool temperatures between 15 and 20°C (may vary depending on area). Hot  dry weather will in turn slow or hinder the development of the fungus and the incidence of the disease. It is more a problem in plants used for seed production and sweet corn. Plants cultivated as livestock feed  for industrial products  or to make processed foods are not concerned. Yield is reduced due to lower plant productivity and lodging. , No alternative treatment against Puccinia sorghi is available so far. Please get in touch with us in case you know of anything that might help to fight this disease. Looking forward to hearing from you. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. The application of fungicides can be beneficial when used on susceptible varieties. Apply a foliar fungicide early in the season if rust is bound to spread rapidly due to the weather conditions. Numerous fungicides are available for rust control. Products containing mancozeb  pyraclostrobin  pyraclostrobin + metconazole  pyraclostrobin + fluxapyroxad  azoxystrobin + propiconazole  trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole can be used to control the disease. An example of treatment could be: Spraying of mancozeb @ 2.5 g/l as soon as pustules appear and repeat at 10 days interval till flowering. 
Corn_(maize)___Northern_Leaf_Blight,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/northern-leaf-blight-of-maize-1.jpg, The symptoms appear as small  oval  water-soaked spots on the lower leaves first. As the disease progresses  they start to appear on the upper part of the plant. Older spots slowly grow into tan  long cigar-shaped necrotic lesions with distinct dark specks and pale green  water-soaked borders. These lesions later coalesce and engulf a large part of the leaf blade and stalk  sometimes leading to death and lodging. If the infection spreads to the upper parts of the plant during the development of the cob. Severe yield losses can occur (up to 70%). , The fungus overwinters in the soil or on plant debris.  Rainfall  night dew  high humidity and moderate temperatures favor the dispersion of the the fungus. Carried by wind or rain splashes it first spreads from the soil onto the lower leaves of young maize plants. Rainy conditions and poor field practices favor its spread to other plants and within fields. Optimal temperatures for infection are in the range of 18 to 27°C during the growing season. A prolonged period of 6 to 18 hours of leaf wetness are also necessary. Sorghum is another favorite host of the fungus. , Bio-fungicides based on Trichoderma harzianum  or Bacillus subtilis can be applied at different stages to decrease the risk of infection. Application of sulfur solutions is also effective. , An integrated approach with preventive measures together with careful cultural practices is recommended. An early preventative fungicide application can be an effective way of controlling the disease. Otherwise  fungicides can be applied when the symptoms are visible on lower canopy to protect the upper leaves and ears. Apply sprays based on azoxystrobin  picoxystrobin  mancozeb  pyraclostrobin  propiconazole  tetraconazole Apply products based on picoxystrobin + cyproconazole  pyraclostrobin + metconazole  propiconazole + azoxystrobin  prothioconazole + trifloxystrobin.  Seed treatments are not recommended. 
Grape___Black_rot,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/black-rot-of-grape-grape-1575457334.jpg, Irregular spots appear on the leaves  which are framed by a dark line. Shoots  stems and leaf stalks can also show symptoms of these spots. If leaf stalks are affected the whole leaves will dry. Grapes will show grey discolorations in the first beginning  which then turn to reddish-brown or violet spots. The fruit will become deformed and eventually be shriveled and black mummified. , The damage is caused by the fungus Phyllosticta ampelicida. The pathogen overwinters in infested shoots or fruit mummies on the grapevine or the soil. The spores will be ejected by light rainfall and then dispersed via wind. Optimal growth conditions are met at 25°C and 6 hours of constant leaf wetness. The fungus prefers warm and humid weather. Reduced fruit yield. , Immediately after blooming stage you can spray Bacillus thuringiensis. , Chemical applications are done in a preventive manner. Start spraying roughly two weeks before bloom with captan + mycobutanil or mancozeb + mycobutanil. Just before the blossoms open you can also use carbaryl or imidcloprid. Post-bloom spray mancozeb + mycobutanil  imidacloprid or azadirachtin. Ten days after bloom you can also apply a mixture of captan and sulfur on your vines. Because most grape varieties become resistant to the infection three to four weeks after bloom  chemical sprays should be avoided at that time. 
Peach___Bacterial_spot,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/bacterial-spot-and-speck-of-tomato-tomato-1584010249.jpg, Symptoms can be seen on the foliage  stems  and fruits of tomatoes. Initially small yellow-green lesions appear on young leaves for bacterial spot  whilst bacterial speck causes black spots with a narrow yellow halo. They are usually more numerous on leaf margins or tips  which may appear deformed and twisted. In severe cases  the spots of bacterial speck may coalesce or overlap  resulting in larger and irregular lesions. Bacterial spot lesions can enlarge from 0.25 cm to 0.5 cm and become tan to brownish-red  which will eventually look like shot holes when the center dries up. Bacterial spot produces similar lesion of fruits as it does on the leaves and eventually roughen  becoming brown and scabbed. Bacterial speck causes tiny  slightly raised black specks. It is difficult to distinguish between these two diseases at an early stage. , Bacterial Spot and Speck are caused by several species of bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas  and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Bacterial spot occurs worldwide and is one of the most devastating diseases on tomatoes grown in warm  moist environments. The pathogens can survive in or on seeds  plant debris  and specific weeds. Xanthomonas has a limited survival period of days to weeks in the soil. Secondary infection can occur through rain or overhead irrigation. It enters the plant tissues through leaf pores and wounds. Optimal temperatures range from 25 to 30°C for the bacterial spot. Once the crop is infected  the disease is very difficult to control and can lead to total crop losses. Bacterial speck outbreaks are relatively infrequent and are favored by prolonged leaf moisture and cool temperatures. , Bacterial Spot is very difficult to control and also expensive to treat. If the disease occurs early in the season  consider destroying the entire crop. Copper-containing bactericides provide a protective cover on foliage and fruit for both bacteria. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) that specifically kill the bacteria are available for the bacterial spot. Submerging seeds for one minute in 1.3% sodium hypochlorite or in hot water (50°C) for 25 minutes can reduce the incidence of both diseases. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments  if available. Copper-containing bactericides can be used as a protectant and give partial disease control. Application at first sign of disease and then at 10 to 14-day intervals when warm (spot) / cold (speck)  moist conditions prevail. As the development of resistance to copper is frequent  a combination of copper-based bactericide with mancozeb is also recommended. 
Pepper_bell___Bacterial_spot,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/bacterial-spot-of-pepper-pepper-1560240277.jpg, The first symptoms are small  yellow-green lesions on young leaves  which usually appear deformed and twisted. On older foliage  lesions are rather angular  dark-green  and greasy in appearance  often surrounded by yellow circles. They are often more numerous on leaf margins or tips. Eventually  the spots look like shot holes because the center dries up and disintegrates. Fruit spots (up to 0.5 cm) start off as pale-green  water-soaked areas  which eventually roughen  becoming brown and scabbed. , Bacterial spot occurs worldwide and is one of the most devastating diseases on pepper and tomato crops grown in warm  moist environments.  The pathogen can survive in association with seeds  either externally or internally as well as on specific weeds and later spreads through rain or overhead irrigation. It enters the plant through leaf pores and wounds. Optimum temperatures range from 25 to 30°C. Once the crop is infected  the disease is very difficult to control and can lead to total crop losses. , Bacterial Spot is very difficult and expensive to treat. If the disease occurs early in the season  consider destroying the entire crop. Copper-containing bactericides provide a protective cover on foliage and fruit. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) that specifically kill the bacteria are available.  Submerge seeds for one minute in 1.3% sodium hypochlorite or in hot water (50°C) for 25 minutes. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Copper-containing bactericides can be used as a protectant and give partial disease control. Application at the first sign of disease and then at 10- to 14-day intervals when warm  moist conditions prevail. The active ingredients copper and mancozeb give a better protection. 
Potato___Early_blight,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/early-blight-pepper-1560240974.jpg, Symptoms of early blight occur on older foliage  stem  and fruits. Gray to brown spots appear on leaves and gradually grow in a concentric manner around a clear center - the characteristic “bullseye” formation. These lesions are surrounded by a bright yellow halo. As the disease progresses  entire leaves may turn chlorotic and shed  leading to significant defoliation. When leaves die and fall  fruits become more vulnerable to sun scald. The same type of spots with a clear center appears on stems and fruits. The fruits begin to rot and may eventually fall off. , Symptoms are caused by Alternaria solani  a fungus that overwinters on infected crop debris in soil or on alternative hosts. Purchased seeds or seedlings may also be already contaminated. Lower leaves often get infected when in contact with contaminated soil. Warm temperatures (24-29°C) and high humidity (90%) favor development of the disease. A long wet period (or alternating wet/dry weather) enhances the production of spores  which may be spread via wind  splashing rain or overhead irrigation. Tubers harvested green or in wet conditions are particularly susceptible to an infection. It often strikes after a period of heavy rainfall and is particularly destructive in tropical and subtropical areas. , Application of products based on Bacillus subtilis or copper-based fungicides registered as organic can treat this disease. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. There are numerous fungicides on the market for controlling early blight. Fungicides based on or combinations of azoxystrobin  pyraclostrobin  difenoconazole  boscalid  chlorothalonil  fenamidone  maneb  mancozeb  trifloxystrobin  and ziram can be used. Rotation of different chemical compounds is recommended. Apply treatments in a timely manner  taking into account weather conditions. Check carefully the preharvest interval at which you can harvest safely after the application of these products. 
Potato___Late_blight,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/potato-late-blight-3.jpg, Dark brown spots develop on the leaves starting at the tip or the leaf margins. In humid climates  these spots become water-soaked lesions. A white fungal covering can be seen on the underside of the leaves. As the disease progresses  entire leaves become necrotic  turn brown and die off. Similar lesions develop on stems and petioles. The potato tubers have greyish-blue spots on their skin and their flesh also turns brown  making them inedible. The rotting of the infested fields emits a distinctive odor. , This fungus is an obligate parasite. This means that it must overwinter in plant debris and tubers as well as on alternative hosts to survive. It enters the plant via wounds and rips in the skin. Fungal spores germinate at higher temperatures during the spring and spread through wind or water. The disease is more severe in periods of cool nights (below 18°C)  warm days (18-22°C)  and extended wet conditions such as rain and fog (90% relative humidity). In these conditions  a late blight epidemic can occur. , Apply copper-based fungicides before dry weather. Foliar sprays of organic coating agents can also prevent the infection. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Fungicide applications are important to control late blight  particularly in humid areas. Contact fungicides that coat leaves are effective before infections and do not trigger resistance in the fungi. Fungicides containing mandipropamid  chlorothalonil  fluazinam  or mancozeb can also be used as a preventive treatment. Seed treatment before sowing with fungicides like mancozeb also work. 
Squash___Powdery_mildew,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/powdery-mildew-melon-1580314319.jpg, The infection usually starts off as circular  powdery white spots which can affect leaves  stems and sometimes fruits.

Strawberry___Leaf_scorch,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/cherry-leaf-scorch-1.jpg," The disease can vary in severity from host to host  also depending on environmental conditions. In spring  pale-green spots appear on leaves  either between the veins or along the margins. The spots later turn yellow to red  sometimes with a yellow halo  and can also develop on the fruit and stem. As they enlarge  they coalesce and develop into brown blotches that are no longer limited by the veins. These patches of necrotic tissue are dotted with dark brown or black specks that are visible to the naked eye. Eventually  the leaves wither  curling in the process. Usually  they are not shed  but remain hanging on the tree. Brown lesions can occasionally appear on the surface of fruits and deformations and cracks can ensue. Usually though  only leaves are affected and despite being striking  the disease rarely cause significant damage to the tree. 
 ", Cherry leaf scorch is caused by the fungus Apiognomonia erythrostoma  which can affect  besides cherry  plum and apricot trees. The fungus overwinters in fallen leaves on the orchard floor or on those hanging on the trees. In spring  when favorable temperatures are reached  the fungus germinates and begins to produce spores that are later spread onto healthy leaves by wind or rain. Leaves remain susceptible throughout the growing season  which implies that the infection cycle can be repeated several times over the year. This is highly dependent on the environmental conditions and the developmental stage of the tree itself. Cherry leaves must be unfolded and the fruit must have attained a visible size to be infected. The disease usually affects weakened trees and can be a sign of a underlying stress in the orchard  such as drought or root damage.  , No biological control solution seems to be available for this disease. Please contact us if you know of any.  , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological solutions if available. Chemicals containing one of the following active ingredients can be used preventively or curatively: bitertanol  copper  dithianon  dodine  fenbuconazole  or ziram. Fungicides work best if combined with field sanitation and other listed preventive measures.  
Tomato___Bacterial_spot,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/bacterial-spot-and-speck-of-tomato-tomato-1584010249.jpg, Symptoms can be seen on the foliage  stems  and fruits of tomatoes.

Check carefully the preharvest interval at which you can harvest safely after the application of these products. 
Tomato___Late_blight,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/tomato-late-blight-tomato-1556463954.jpg, Brownish-green spots appear on the leaf margins and leaf tops. Later  large areas of the leaves turn brown completely. During wet weather  lesions on the lower side of the leaves may be covered with a gray to white moldy growth  making it easier to distinguish healthy from dead leaf tissue. As the disease progresses  the foliage runs brown  curls and dries. In some cases  the sharply delimited brown spots and the white covering also appear on the stems  branches  and petioles. Greyish-green to dirty-brown and wrinkled stains appear on the fruits. At these spots  the fruit flesh is hardened. , The risk of infection is highest in midsummer. The fungus enters the plant via wounds and rips in the skin. Temperature and moisture are the most important environmental factors affecting the development of the disease. Late blight fungi grow best in high relative humidities (around 90%) and in temperature ranges of 18 to 26°C. Warm and dry summer weather can bring the spread of the disease to a halt. , At this point  there is no biological control of known efficacy against late blight. To avoid spreading  remove and destroy plants around the infected spot immediately and do not compost infected plant material. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Use fungicide sprays based on mandipropamid  chlorothalonil  fluazinam  mancozeb to combat late blight. Fungicides are generally needed only if the disease appears during a time of year when rain is likely or overhead irrigation is practiced. 
Tomato___Leaf_Mold,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/leaf-mold-of-tomato-1.jpg, Symptoms commonly occur on both sides of the foliage and sometimes on fruit. Older leaves are infected first and then the disease slowly moves up towards young leaves. On the upper leaf surface  small  diffuse  pale green or yellowish spots with indefinite margins appear. On the underside  olive green to grayish purple and velvety patches develop below the leaf spots. These are composed of spore-producing structures and spore masses (conidia). Over time  as the spots enlarge  the color of the infected leaf changes from yellowish (chlorosis) to brown (necrosis) and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop prematurely  leading to defoliation in severe cases. Occasionally  this pathogen causes disease on the blossoms or fruits with various symptoms. The blossoms may turn black and will be killed before fruit set. Green and ripe fruits will develop smooth black irregular area on the stem end. As the disease progresses  the infected area becomes sunken  dry and leathery. , The symptoms are caused by the fungus Mycovellosiella fulva  whose spores can survive without a host for 6 months to a year at room temperature (non-obligate). Prolonged leaf moisture and humidities above 85% favor the germination of spores. The temperature must be between 4° to 34 °C for spores to germinate  with an optimum temperature at 24-26°C. Dry conditions and the absence of free water on leaves impair germination. The symptoms usually start to appear 10 days after inoculation with the development of spots on both sides of the leaf blade. On the underside  a large number of spore-producing structures are formed and these spores are easily spread from plant to plant by the wind and water splashing  but also on tools  clothing of workers and insects. The pathogen usually infects the leaves by penetrating through stomata in a high humidity level. , Seed treatment with hot water (25 minutes at 122 °F or 50 °C) is recommended to avoid the pathogen on seeds. The fungi Acremonium strictum  Dicyma pulvinata  Trichoderma harzianum or T. viride and Trichothecium roseum are antagonistic to M. fulva and could be used to reduce its spread. In greenhouse trials the growth of M. fulva on tomatoes was inhibited by A. strictum  Trichoderma viride strain 3 and T. roseum by 53  66 and 84% respectively. In small arms  apple-cider  garlic or milk sprays and vinegar mix can be used to treat the mold. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Applications should be made prior to infection when environmental conditions are optimal for the development of the disease. Recommended compounds in field use are chlorothalonil  maneb  mancozeb and copper formulations. For greenhouses  difenoconazole  mandipropamid  cymoxanil  famoxadone and cyprodinil are recommended. 
Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/septoria-leaf-spot-tomato-2.jpg, Symptoms spread upwards from oldest to youngest growth. Small  water-soaked grey circular spots with dark-brown margins appear on the undersides of older leaves. At later stages of the disease  the spots enlarge and coalesce  and black dots appear in their centers. The same pattern may also be observed on stems and blossoms  but rarely on fruit. Heavily infected leaves will turn slightly yellow  wither  and fall off. The defoliation leads to sun scalding of fruit. , Septoria leaf spot occurs worldwide and is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici. The fungus infects only plants of the family of potato and tomato. The temperature range for the development of the fungus varies between 15° and 27°C  with optimal growth at 25°C. Spores might be spread by overhead water  splashing rain  hands and clothing of pickers  insects such as beetles  and cultivation equipment. It overwinters on solanaceous weeds and for short periods in soils or soil debris. , Copper-based fungicides  such as Bordeaux mixture  copper hydroxide  copper sulfate  or copper oxychloride sulfate might help control the pathogen. Apply at 7 to 10 day intervals throughout the late season. Follow harvest restrictions listed on the pesticide label. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Fungicides containing maneb  mancozeb  chlorothalonil effectively control Septoria leaf spot. Apply at 7 to 10 day intervals throughout the season  mainly during flowering and fruit setting. Follow harvest restrictions listed on the pesticide label. 
Tomato___Target_Spot,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/target-spot-of-soybean-1.jpg, Target spot is mostly a foliar disease. Leaves show round to irregular reddish-brown spots surrounded by a yellowish green halo. The growth of these spots often results in a zonate pattern of light- or dark brown rings  hence the common name target spot. Stems and stalks can also be affected and usually develop dark brown specks or elongated lesions. Small  circular black spots later appear on pods. Severe infections may cause leaves to drop prematurely. , The fungus Corynespora cassiicola overwinters on crop debris and in the soil. Favorable conditions for the infection are high humidity (>80%) and free moisture on leaves. Dry weather will suppress the development of the disease. The disease is potentially serious on late-maturing varieties or on susceptible varieties in seasons of high rainfall. , No alternative treatment is available against target spot disease. , Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatment if available. The use of fungicides is rarely economically viable. Products containing  mixtures of pyraclostrobin   epoxiconazole and fluxapyroxad or bixafen  prothioconazole and trifloxystrobin might help to control the fungus. 
Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus,https://content.peat-cloud.com/w400/tomato-yellow-leaf-curl-virus-tomato-1575981863.jpg, Infection at seedling stage results in  severe stunting of young leaves and shoots  leading to a somewhat bushy growth of the plant. In older plants  the infection results in excessive branching  thicker and wrinkled leaves  and interveinal chlorosis clearly visible on the leaf blade. At later stages of the disease  the plants take a leathery texture and their chlorotic margins are rolled upwards and inwards. If the infection takes place before the flowering stage  the number of fruits is considerably reduced  even though there are no noticeable symptoms on their surface. , TYLCV is not seed-borne and is not transmitted mechanically. It is spread by whiteflies of the Bemisia tabaci species. These whiteflies feed on the lower leaf surface of a number of plants and are attracted by young tender plants. The whole infection cycle can take place in about 24 hours and is favored by dry weather with high temperatures. , There is no treatment against TYLCV. Control the whitefly population to avoid the infection with the virus. , Once infected with the virus  there are no treatments against the infection. Control the whitefly population to avoid the infection with the virus. Insecticides of the family of the pyrethroids used as soil drenches or spray during the seedling stage can reduce the population of whiteflies. However  their extensive use might promote resistance development in whitefly populations.
